          <p>Sodagreen (Chinese: 蘇打綠) is a Taiwanese indie band
        formed in 2001. Its members have been unchanged since 2003. Sodagreen
         emerged in the Taiwanese indie music scene after receiving
          the Grand Jury Award in the Hohaiyan Gongliau Rock
          Festival in 2004, after which it signed a contract with
          Willlin Music. The band is the first indie band to hold
          a concert in the Taipei Arena. The band is well known
          for its main vocalist and songwriter Wu Tsing-Fong, who
          is prominent for his poetic lyrics, unique performing style,
          and wide vocal range.</p>
            <p>Sodagreen was named by Shih, the band's leader at the time,
          and Wu, the lead vocalist. The band was originally named Soda (蘇打),
          but Shih preferred a name with three-syllable.
          Wu then affixed the word green (綠), his favourite colour, behind Soda,
          completing the portmanteau.</p>
            <p>In May 2001, Sodagreen competed in the Golden Melody Cup
          held by the National Chengchi University and won the
          Best Popularity award with the composition "Peeping".
          With the support of Shiao-Ying, a judge at the competition,
          it recorded "Peeping" for the compilation Taiwan independent
          compilation 2001, released by TCM. In April the next year,
          after several changes to the line-up of the band (guitarists),
          Sodagreen participated in the Golden Melody Cup again, this time
          winning the awards for Best Band, Best Composition,
          Best Lyrics and Best Music.</p>
